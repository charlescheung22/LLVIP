The goal of our project is to detect objects ("pedestrians") using a combination of Visible and Infrared (VIR) light. 
- The dataset to be used is [LLVIP](https://github.com/bupt-ai-cz/LLVIP).
- System accuracy will be tested by splitting into the classing Train Verify Test triplets. Recall, FPS can also be tested. Mean Average Precision (mAP), Average Precision[small] (AP_small) can be attempted if there is additional time.
